# Color-Filter-Array-Interpolation-Algorithms-and-VLSI-Design
This personal project applied image processing algorithms and hardware design skills to design novel hardware-oriented color de-mosaicking algorithms, saving at least 11% hardware and 91% power, and improving the average CPSNR by over 1.785 dB. The research results has published in the IEEE journal and commercialized into an intellectual property.
