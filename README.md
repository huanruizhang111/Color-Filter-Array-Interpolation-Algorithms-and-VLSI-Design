# Color-Filter-Array-Interpolation-Algorithms-and-VLSI-Design
This personal project applied image processing algorithms and hardware design skills to design novel hardware-oriented color de-mosaicking algorithms, saving at least 11% hardware and 91% power, and improving the average CPSNR by over 1.785 dB. The research results has published in the IEEE journal and commercialized into an intellectual property.

**Work flow for this project**:

  Step 1: Literatural review

  Step 2: Innovate novel de-mosaicking algorithms

  Step 3: Implement the ideas in MATLAB simulation to see the CPSNR

  Step 4: If the CPSNR in step 3 is great, then I will write Verilog to simulate the algorithm and check how much the hardware costs. Otherwise, I need to go back to step 2. Note that an algorithm which achieves high CPSNR does not mean it is suitable for implementing in hardware, as it may cost too much hardware. Hence, how to balance the hardware costs and CPSNR is the most challenging part of this research.

  Step 5: Finalize the research results
